# basketballCss
This assignment adds on to my original, basketballHtml assignment. I added an external style sheet to practice CSS.

Although I played with the padding, borders and margins throughout, the place where I showed the most understanding of the CSS box model was with my the stylization if the link to the website where I got my number of high school basketball player data.
